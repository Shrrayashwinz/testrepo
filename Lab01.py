In Python coding, we have to use variables to store data that can be referenced and used when executing a program. A variable is a name that is assigned to a value. Python variables don’t need an explicit declaration of type, and the type of the variable is inferred based on the value assigned. Variables serve as placeholders for data. 

To use the variables effectively, we need to follow Python’s naming rules. The first rule is that variable names can only have letters, digits, numbers, and underscores (_). Next, the variable name cannot start with a number/digit. In addition, the variable names are case-sensitive. Finally, you should avoid using Python Keywords (such as but not limited to if, else, for) as variable names. 

In terms of using variables, there are some methods of doing so. In terms of Basic Assignment, variables are assigned to the a  = operator.   For example, x = 5, name = “Shrrayash”.

Python values can also be dynamically typed, which means one variable can hold different values during execution. For example, x = 10 and x = “Class_Rocks”.

In addition, you can assign the same value to many variables in a single line. For example, a = b = c = 100. 

We can also assign different values to different variables simultaneously, which makes the code much easier to read.
